class="Formatted"><i>Fledgling</i>, Octavia Butler's new novel after a seven year break, is the story of an apparently young, amnesiac girl whose alarmingly inhuman needs and abilities lead her to a startling conclusion: She is in fact a genetically modified, 53-year-old vampire. Forced to discover what she can about her stolen former life, she must at the same time learn who wanted - and still wants - to destroy her and those she cares for and how she can save herself. <i>Fledgling</i> is a captivating novel that tests the limits of "otherness" and questions what it means to be truly human.</span></div></div></div></div><div data-testid="genresList"

She won both Hugo and Nebula awards. In 1995, she became the first science fiction writer to receive the MacArthur Foundation "Genius" Grant.<br /><br />After her father died, Butler was raised by her widowed mother. Extremely shy as a child, Octavia found an outlet at the library reading fantasy, and in writing. She began writing science fiction as a teenager. She attended community college during the Black Power movement, and while participating in a local writer's workshop was encouraged to attend the Clarion Workshop, which focused on science fiction.<br /><br />She soon sold her first stories and by the late 1970s had become sufficiently successful as an author that she was able to pursue writing full-time. Her books and short stories drew the favorable attention of the public and awards judges. She also taught writer's workshops, and eventually relocated to Washington state. Butler died of a stroke at the age of 58. Her papers are held in the research collection of the Huntington Library.</span></div></div></div></div><hr class="Divider"/><div class="NativeAdWrapper"> <div class="Ad Ad__nativeAd"

this more than I did simply because I am a big fan of Kindred. I was slightly ambivalent about another book on vampires, however, and while I tried not to take that into serious account when reading Butler, it still crept in.<br /><br />Mostly, however, I liked the book fine. Any major issues I have can be neatly summed up in my opinion on quasi-pedophile literature in general. It's designed to make us squirm. If it doesn't make you squirm then maybe you're reading just a tad too much pedo-literature. Suffice to say, I squirmed a lot. I tried telling myself over and over that a 53-year-old vampire with amnesia with the body of an eleven-year-old girl should be judged on the stated facts alone, not by the super-creepy visceral feel it evokes. <br /><br />Putting that aside, the rest of the novel doesn't break any new ground. Far from it. Can anyone else remember a novel that starts out with an amnesiac MC? Anyone? Is it one out of six novels? By proportion, I do believe that about that many of us in real life must be amnesiac. It makes sense, doesn't it? That's probably why we keep forgetting how many times we've read novels with amnesiac main characters.<br /><br />Moving on. Slow build, discovery that we're dead. Check. Mind-rolling all the first people we meet. Check. Falling into long-term relationships with these random people. Check. Now let's have a little violence and ask the question of why. Uh oh. Vampire politics. Check. <br /><br />Voila! One vampire novel to order. It did have a kinda courtroom feel at the end, no? *sigh*<br /><br />I may sound like I hated this novel, but no. Like I said, it was fine. Not extremely creative, just a tad or a bit more than a lot of creepy. The horror aspect went away pretty early and the novel fell into a comfortable settle in with her mind rolled lovers before it became Law and Order for bloodsuckers. It just feels like I've read this book before. Many times. And the only thing that makes it stand out is the fact that it creeps my non-pedo-self out. That's not exactly high praise.<br /><br />*sigh*<br /><br />Next, please.</span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><span class="TruncatedItems

I love Octavia Butler, I have been avoiding <i>Fledgling</i> for a while because <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/61034231" rel="nofollow noopener">Twilight*</a> and the “paranormal romance” genre that followed in its wake are anathema to me. I knew of course that Ms. Butler would never slum it with Stephenie Meyer, but the subject matter is kind of spoiled for me. Still, I am running out of Octavias to read so I did not want to skip one of her - all too few – novels just because of my disillusion with vampire fiction in general.<br><br>Octavia Butler writes entertaining books but they are never mindless entertainments, she always has her (non-pecuniary) reasons for writing them. So when she takes on the popular vampire genre you can be sure there is more to the story than sexy neck biting. To say that <i>Fledgling</i> is an allegory is to disregard Ms. Butler’s love of storytelling for its own sake. The book is not all about the allegory, you can completely ignore the underlying message and still enjoy the finely crafted narrative. Perhaps it will make you reflect on something you have experienced in real life, perhaps not, it does not matter. As usual with Octavia Butler's books, I found it to be compelling from page one. There was no need to familiarize myself with the setting, or the style, no need to take a peek at the book’s synopsis, just dive into it and let the lady work her magic.<br><br><i>Fledgling</i> is about Shori, a “young” 53-year-old vampire. At the beginning of the book, she wakes up in a cave, badly burned, injured, blind, and without memory of who or what she is. Fortunately, some poor, unsuspecting creature comes within her reach and she immediately eats it and starts healing rapidly, though her memory remains lost. She stumbles onto a road and a kindly unsuspecting chap picks her up in his car, to take her to a hospital. She refuses to go to a hospital, he won’t hear of her objections and so she bit him. A strange symbiotic relationship begins.<br><br>The main plot of the book concerns Shori’s attempt to find who tried to kill her, caused her to lose her memory, and - as she later learns -killed her entire family.<br><br><i>“It doesn’t seem fair that you can’t convert us like all the stories say.” <br>“That would be very strange,” I said. “If a dog bit a man, no one would expect the man to become a dog. He might get an infection and die, but that’s the worst.”</i><br><br>As I mentioned earlier, this is a sci-fi variation of vampire fiction. The vampires are not supernatural creatures but another species called “Ina” that have been living in secret among humans for as long as they can remember. They do need blood but they do not kill humans for it. Instead, they form symbiotic relationships with selected humans, and the symbionts benefit from the chemicals in Ina’s venom which extend their lives and cure their illnesses.<br><br><i>“His memory should improve because I was with him, because now and then, I would bite him, injecting whatever I injected into people when I bit them.”</i><br><br>The sci-fi aspect of <i>Fledgling</i> makes a nice change and the concept somewhat more believable. The novel is masterfully plotted and paced without a dull moment, though some readers may be put off by the odd (non-explicit) scenes of kinky vampire sex, and moments of sentimentality. Shori, in spite of being a vampire, is a fairly typical Butler protagonist, strong-willed, compassionate, and black. The theme of being an outcast, being lonely, and having the courage and moral fortitude to overcome these issues in a positive manner is something Butler often returns to.<br><img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1471750787i/20102383.jpg" class="gr-hostedUserImg"> <br>The author has some fun with the vampire tropes (as can be seen from some of the quotes below) but, more importantly, she weaved in the perennial themes of tolerance, dealing with racial prejudice, and fortitude in the face of adversity. There is some violence in this book, nothing overly graphic or extreme; it would be nice to be able to resolve all conflicts without resorting violence but this is not really an option under the circumstances here.<br><br>So, another very satisfying Octavia Butler book, I think I only have a couple left unread, and one of them is an anthology. (╥﹏╥)<br><br>______________________<br>* Link to my *cough!* “insightful” review ಠ‿↼<br><br><b>Quotes:</b><br><i>“I wound up eating most of someone’s little nanny goat. I didn’t mean to take a domestic animal, but it was all I found after hours of searching. It must have escaped from some farm. Better the goat than its owner.”<br><br>“Invite me in.” <br>At once, she stood aside and said, “Come in.”<br>This was a bit of vampire theater. I knew it, and I was fairly sure she knew it, too. She had probably been brushing up on vampires recently. Of course, I didn’t need permission to enter her home or anyone else’s.<br><br>“Tell me about the lawyers.” “One of the ones I bit might be good for you,” Wayne said.</i></span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><span class="TruncatedItems TruncatedItems--span"><span class="TruncatedItems__item

class="Formatted">3.5 – 4 stars <br /><br />Another vampire book review from the guy who says he’s not a fan of vampires? Yeah, well I’m trying to find the good ones, not the dreck that’s jumped onto the Twilight bandwagon. And quite frankly I didn’t pick this one up because it was a vampire book per se, but because it was one by Octavia Butler, whose work I’ve been meaning to look into more, and this is the only stand-alone that I’m aware of. It turned out to be a good book, though there are some possibly ‘problematic’ issues with it.<br /><br />In some ways there are superficial resemblances between this one and the last vampire book I read <a href="https://goodreads.com/book/show/943402.Let_the_Right_One_In" title="Let the Right One In by John Ajvide Lindqvist" rel="noopener">Let the Right One In</a>: both books have as their star apparently pre-pubescent vampires who have ‘complicated’ relationships with their human companions. In Lindqvist’s case it was a Renfield-like adult who was enamoured of the vampire-child for whom he obtained blood and the young boy who becomes a part of her life. In the case of Butler’s book the vampire in question, Shori, isn’t even only apparently pre-pubescent…according to vampire physiology she is in fact still a child, though that still translates to her being much older than her appearance would suggest (around 52 years old in fact). Despite this fact the relationships she has with the humans around her bear all of the appearances of a pedophilic relationship, at least from the outside.<br /><br />You see in Butler’s take on the vampire mythology the Ina (what vampires call themselves) are not undead. They don’t actually know what they are, whether it be an off-shoot of humanity or an alien race, but they are incredibly long-lived, are harmed by direct sunlight, and require blood (preferably human blood) to survive. So far Butler follows the myth pretty closely. Where she deviates to the greatest extent is around the relationships that they have with their ‘prey’. Far from being nocturnal hunters out to slaughter as many human cattle as possible to feed their blood thirst, these vampires actually maintain a group of humans (called symbionts) who share their lives with the Ina and in exchange for the benefits that Ina venom provides to humans they give the vampire their blood, as well as personal and emotional companionship. What benefits does the venom in Ina saliva provide? Well longer life for one: human symbionts live about twice as long as normal humans. They are also immune to most illnesses and tend to stay young through most of their lives as symbionts (depending on when they were ‘turned’ of course). The sex is also great. The mere act of being fed upon seems to provoke a reaction in the symbiont akin to the best sex you’ve ever had, and the Ina also like indulging in sex-play with their symbionts and the fact that they aren’t cross-fertile is just icing on the cake, right? The down-side? Well symbionts become addicted to the Ina venom in their body…actually to the specific venom of their personal Ina, and will soon go crazy and die without it. They also end up having an attachment to their Ina that is so close they cannot refuse a request (or order) made by them. Also if they are the jealous kind they will likely have an uncomfortable life in the Ina’s family since one Ina generally requires at least seven or eight humans to be his or her personal symbionts (or harem if you will) so there’s a lot of sharing…of everything…going on.<br /><br />How does this all play out when the Ina in question is apparently an eleven year old black girl whose first symbiont is a white male in his mid-twenties? I’ll let you decide. All I can say is that I enjoyed the story from most angles. Butler’s idea that vampires would be more likely to shepherd the humans they require for survival instead of going on nightly and gratuitous killing sprees made a heck of a lot of sense. I’ve always wondered what those vampires in stories where they are coming out of hiding and hunting down humanity are thinking: who are they going to feed on once they wipe out the human race and why create an imminent resource shortage even if they plan on doing something about it in the long term? <br /><br />The story opens as Shori awakens in pain and confusion in a cave and immediately succumbs to her base instincts in order to survive. As she continues to hunt, feed, and heal she comes more to herself, but still has no memory of exactly who, or what, she is. Eventually she makes her way down to a nearby community that has been utterly destroyed in a fire. There are no bodies and she has no memory of the place, but thinks it may have something to do with her. Deciding to look for other people in the hope that they can help her she eventually comes across Wright and finds herself instinctively attracted to him and ends up making him her first ‘symbiont’. Together they must learn exactly who and what Shori is and their questions lead them into dangerous territory, for it turns out that Shori was an experiment of some members of the Ina/vampire community: an attempt to graft Ina with human African-American genes in order to combat their natural weakness to the sun. Not all members of the Ina community were in favour of this and so Shori’s quest of discovery also becomes a fight for survival as she slowly tries to regain a semblance of what she was before her ‘accident’.<br /><br />Any ick factor aside I thought that Butler’s depiction of the relationships that developed between Ina and their symbionts was well done. There are obviously questions of freedom and choice involved here. After all if you were basically chemically conditioned to love someone, to obey them, to be utterly devoted to them what would it mean about any choice, any feeling you had for them? On the other hand, most symbionts are made aware of the implications of their union with an Ina before any final step is taken in the bonding…of course that might just be akin to saying they only give the addict a couple of doses of the drug and they aren’t yet technically dependent on it before asking them if they want any more. Still I got the feeling that most of the relationships between Ina and symbionts were loving and ‘real’ and it was apparent that the Ina were just as dependent on their symbionts as vice versa, and not just for blood: the emotional bond seemed to go both ways. So, does Butler turn love, devotion, and desire into purely biological responses and imperatives or could it be argued that even in human relationships they already are? How much of what we do and decide about those in our lives is truly ‘free’? How much is pre-determined by our biology, our experiences, and our background? Who can say what’s really behind that ‘spark’ that attracts you to one person and not another? It may not be Ina venom, but is it something any less chemically or physiologically induced? I don’t know I’m just rambling here, but for some reason I just wasn’t as bothered by the venom element of the Ina-Symbiont bond. Maybe I’m just a submissive at heart.<br /><br />There is of course also an investigation of race and purity. Not only is Shori visibly Black, a member of a human minority (though apparently to Ina that has no importance), she is a hybrid: a half-breed mix of Ina and human genes whose end is to produce a better, stronger Ina capable of overcoming the natural weaknesses and limitations of the traditional ‘pure breed’. So now we have Shori straddling an interesting dichotomy: on the one hand she is basically the product of a eugenic experiment (though one whose methods appear to have been benign) whose end goal is something that might be called a ‘master race’; on the other hand she is the victim of horrific persecution and bigotry for not being ‘pure Ina’ and her life, and that of those she loves, is in danger as a result. <br /><br />Will you like this story? I don’t know. I did, but I can see how many people would find it, as I mentioned above, problematic. Butler’s prose is fine, though nothing to write home about and I found a few instances where I thought she over-described a scene (such as adding details about the kind of sandwiches and other paraphernalia they packed for lunch) in ways that seemed unnecessary. Overall though I found myself carried along with the story and thought that she did a very good job of both keeping the plot moving and doing it through the development of well-rounded and interesting characters. Ultimately this was for me a story about just that: characters and the personal relationships and growth that they experienced.</span></div></div></div></section></section><section

Butler who wrote PARABLE OF THE SOWER and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1890164516" rel="nofollow noopener">KINDRED</a>. It felt like it was written by a totally different person. If I hadn't looked at the publication date and seen the "2005," I would have thought that this was a less-successful first novel. That seriously bums me out because I love vampire novels, and the idea of reading a novel about a black vampire that explores the themes of racism within a supernatural context sounded fascinating, especially since I had loved what I'd read of this author before and how she explored similar themes within the science-fiction framework. Joining me in this buddy read was my fellow vampire-lover, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1814843054" rel="nofollow noopener">Heather</a>, who doesn't seem to be into this book either for many of the same reasons I'm about to dive into.<br><br><br><br>Shori is an adolescent vampire who awakes at the beginning of the novel to find herself mortally wounded and in a severe amount of pain. She's picked by a hitchhiker who intends to drive her to the hospital - until she bites him and that makes him sexually attracted to her and crave her like she's a drug and he's an addict. This would be fine <i>if she didn't flipping look like a preteen</i>. It's mentioned several times that she looks like a child, and while complaining about this in one of my status updates, I had someone basically tell me that I shouldn't be so offended. Well, I am. I think that's gross. And I don't care if she's fifty-three in human years, even in vampire years <i>she's prepubescent</i>, because it's mentioned several times that she's not fully developed and can't yet reproduce, even if her sexual organs are functioning (ugh and they are - prepare yourself for incredibly gross sex scenes).<br><br><br><br>I don't have children so I can't imagine how gross and uncomfortable this would be for people who do. I don't want to read about adolescent sex (or sex with people who look adolescent), <i>especially </i>not if it's framed as a functional and desirable relationship. I get that Octavia Butler was a daring writer who pushed boundaries of what was socially acceptable in order to challenge the status quo (something my critic seemed to be arguing, albeit slightly less eloquently), but it's my right to say when I feel like an author goes too far for my own personal tastes. I felt the same way about Bryn Greenwood's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1728474985" rel="nofollow noopener">ALL THE UGLY AND WONDERFUL THINGS</a>, which is basically a romance between an eight-year-old girl and a fully grown man. One person's "oh my god, that's so <i>brave </i>and <i>literar</i>y<i>!</i>" is another person's "no, god no, why would you write that? what the hell?"<br><br><br><br>Apart from the grossness of the female character and her - <i>ahem </i>- relationships with other characters in the book, I did like the way vampires were presented here (they call themselves the Ina, and they have their own rules and social hierarchies that reminded me of the <i>Xenogenesis </i>saga, except that didn't have gross underage freakiness), and I thought the trial at the end was interesting. The problem with this book is that it's slow AF, and while the human and compassionate part of you wants Shori to get revenge for the awful things that happened to her, the reader and hedonist part of you is going to be bored off your ass waiting for anything resembling a climax (EW, no, not that kind of climax - get out of here you gross person) to happen. This is Butler's weakest effort by far.<br><br><br><br>1.5 stars</span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><span class="TruncatedItems TruncatedItems--span"><span

class="Formatted">*** this review has spoilers that will do irreversible damage to those who have not read the book, is long, and is, i'm afraid, rather academic in tone, because i just think that way. be warned. ***<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><i>Fledgling</i> opens with a birth scene of sorts. a little girl (we don’t yet know that she’s a little girl, but find out soon enough) wakes up in a cave in tremendous physical pain. her body is badly injured, more, we gather from the description, than a human being would be able to survive. she’s covered head to toe in severe burn wounds. she can barely move. her skull is fractured in at least two places. she’s blind. she weaves in out of consciousness. <br /><br />besides feeling in agonizing pain, the girl is hungry in a way that feels life-or-death to her. a large animal comes near her. she immediately kills it and eats it raw. a few days later she’s on her feet and well on her way to healing. she hunts down deer, kills them with her bare hands, devours them on the spot. <br /><br />the birth symbols – the cave, the physical pain, the blindness, the total incapacitation, the starving need, the complete amnesia – seem to me to signify both sides of the birth couple. the girl is both baby and mother; she gives (re)birth to herself. <br /><br />what the girl slowly discovers, through well plotted and well paced steps of knowledge and self-knowledge acquisition, is that she’s a vampire who used to live in an all-female community, and that this community was wiped out in its entirety by humans. soon she finds the male community formed her father, brothers and older relatives, but this community, too, is soon almost entirely wiped out by humans.<br /><br />in the meantime shori’s instincts and deeply-rooted needs and desires have led her to discover (everything is a discovery for her, and the amnesia never resolves itself) the pleasure of drinking blood from humans.<br /><br />the rapport between the vampires (or “Ina,” not just a different race but a different species entirely) and the humans they feed on is easily the most mesmerizing, enthralling, and, to me, frankly pleasurable aspect of the novel. in the narrative i can detect – feel? – butler’s easy (she’d been doing this for years, and her novels always tread on the dark edge of the forbidden, which is probably why she chose to write sci-fi or speculative fiction) dipping in her own unconscious, into a pool of profound woman/lesbian longing that is rarely represented in literature. the whole book seems to me an answer to freud’s famous question “what do women want?” it seems both the representation of deep-seated and (therefore) tabooed female desires and the luscious, unbridled fantasy of their fulfillment. butler needs to push the envelope of difference in the desiring subject as much as possible. <br /><br />shori, the first person narrator, is unique both in the cast of characters who people the book and, perhaps more importantly, in the cast of characters who are likely to read the book, in a number of ways. as far as the former is concerned, she’s black (one of her brothers is also black but of a much lighter hue, and anyway he’s quickly dispatched by the assassins who are after shori’s family; a small number of humans are black as well, but their blackness is not a primary issue in the novel the way shori’s is), she’s alone (the Ina live in communities and return to communities: shori is alone and wants to stay that way, form her own family instead of joining an existing one), she’s small for her age, she’s remarkably poised, wise, and intelligent, and, above all, she’s an Ina-human hybrid. this last trait, alongside her blackness, is key in the novel, but since it raises interpretive issues other than the ones i have at heart here, i’ll set it aside. as far as the readers are concerned, she’s unique in being a sexually active, sexually promiscuous child who’s equally attracted to adult men and women.<br /><br />this is the thing that interests me most so this is what i’ll talk about from now on. shori, who looks like a human 10-year-old and is a 53-year-old Ina, is and isn’t a child in both worlds. from a human point of view, she of course belies appearances because she has 53 years of life under her belt. at the same time, not only does she look very much like a little girl to the human eye, but, also, she’s just undergone a pretty thorough and literal rebirth, and her memory is wiped entirely clean. when she gently bites her first human, he, a man of 23, experiences intense sexual (never described as such, but clearly that’s what it is) pleasure, and so does she. soon, she tells him that he can have sex with her if he wants to, because of the bond they have created through her feeding. the man may or may not feel instinctive reluctance to have sex what a small 10-year-old, but does nonetheless. shori is apparently (the sex scenes are not very detailed) an experienced lover, and this makes wright, the young man, feel altogether better, so that they go on to being regular lovers for the rest of the novel. <br /><br />this is of course intensely disturbing to the reader. what is an adult male doing having sex with a little abandoned kid he’s just rescued on the side of the road? vampires and their humans, though, have a unique relationship. first of all, vampires are incredibly powerful, not only physically (they live a long time, are always healthy, heal themselves from injuries, are superhumanly strong, etc.) but emotionally. the moment they bite someone, the person experiences a pleasure that makes him or her little more than putty in the vampire’s hands. what stands between this and exploitation is the profound love vampires have for their symbionst, and ethics. the vampires desire their humans just as much as their humans desire them. their bond is pretty much absolute. even though humans mate with each other and have children of their own (and vampires do the same), the bond between vampires and symbionts is stronger than any other – it is visceral, and necessary to the survival of both. since vampires live as long as four or five hundred years and human symbionts, to whom vampires communicate a lot of their physical gifts, to 150 to 200 years, vampires are doomed to losing their symbionts, and the experience is described in the novel as so devastating as to be barely endurable. whereas, though, vampires can replace their symbionts, symbionts will get sick and possibly die if they lose the vampire to whom they are bonded. other vampires can and will take over out of ethical obligation, but it doesn’t always work.<br /><br />as shori chooses and makes hers human after human, the reader’s pleasure deepens. the first human, wright, has little to no choice. both he and shori have no knowledge of what is going on between them, but, whatever it is, it’s irresistible to both of them. because she can’t feed on one human alone, shori then creeps into a woman’s bed at night and feeds on her. the woman is immediately, profoundly in love, and so is shori. technically they don’t have sex but they might as well have. these are the only two humans shori chooses. the other three she acquires in the book are, two of them, left-behind adult female symbionts of her father’s and brother’s, and, one, an adult male child of another symbiont who falls in love with shori and wants to be with her, and to whom shori is incredibly drawn. in other words, she has a profound attraction to three of her symbionts and only grows to love the other two. (two of her symbionts, the young man and the young woman she inherits from her brother, are also black).<br /><br />the desire/fantasy this book portrays so effectively is that of total control over the love object, if not, possibly, over love itself. i submit that this is the desire/fantasy of those whose sexuality is chronically disempowered – queer people, women, who else? vampires cannot help reciprocating their humans’ love, but making this love authentic rather than exploitative is entirely a matter of ethical upbringing and ethical choices. shori, for instance, has to do violence to herself, at first, to allow herself to learn from her symbionts, some of whom have been living in vampire families for a long time and know way more about her people than she does. her willingness to treat her symbionts as equal is depicted as an act of great respect and humility on her part. <br /><br />much as the symbionts long for her, shori has complete control over whom she feeds on, whom she has sex with, whom she chooses to love. they don’t. she, also, is clearly the head of the family. she decides what gets done when; the symbionts only suggest. moreover, she’s responsible for making the symbionts get along with each other. this last trait is of course reminiscent of motherhood. in fact, the whole feeding-as-a-sexual-act thing is very much a symbol of mother love, even though, in this case, it is the mother(-child) who feeds on the (adult) children. this role reversal is profound on many levels. because it gestures toward the breaking of a primal taboo, it shocks and pleasures at the same time. the smallness of shori’s body is always on the front of the page. she climbs into her symbionts’ laps, is enfolded in their arms, and, when they have traditional intercourse, which happens only with the men, always needs to position herself, and have her symbiont position himself, carefully.<br /><br />interestingly, while butler describes with great intensity the pleasure shori derives from licking her symbionts’ blood (she doesn’t always feed on them; sometimes she just tastes them because it gives them both tremendous pleasure), she does not describe the pleasure she derives from having sex. <br /><br />on the matter of sex: while shori is allowed to have sex with her symbionts, she is not yet allowed to have sex with other vampires, even though there is tremendous attraction between young male vampires and herself. i think she’d probably be around 16 in vampire age, and she’s too young to mate. for one, she couldn’t reproduce, for two, she’s just too young. the rules of proper-age mating hold just fine in the intra-vampire world. <br /><br />which, problematically, sort of dehumanizes the humans. as i was reading the book, i kept slipping into a dissociative mode in which i perceived my dog as a symbiont. she is profoundly bonded to me, and loves me without any capacity for rejection. she obeys me even when it deprives her of pleasure (as when i ask her to go to her bed instead of staying on mine with me). i am bonded to her too, and i am as fiercely protective of her as vampires are of their symbionts. with all probability, she will die sooner than i and her death will devastate me. if i die before she does, someone will take her over out of ethical obligation to me.<br /><br />if we want to eschew the suggestion that butler dehumanizes her humans, we can say that, at least, she infantilizes them. i cannot imagine reading this book if i had kids. i can stand seeing my dog the way vampires in the book see humans, but it would disturb me way too much to see my kids that way.<br /><br />at the same time, seeing myself as a very powerful kid vampire who can control and attract so many adults (significantly, no one, vampire or not, is younger than shori in the book), and has such wise command of her emotions and her body, was tremendously thrilling to me. <br /><br />i don’t know if the thrill i derived from this book is a consequence of my history and some damaged part of my emotional makeup, but i doubt all of those who liked it (and felt disturbed by it) have my same wounds. as i said, i think this book appeals to those – women, queer people, maybe disabled people, etc. – who are at a social disadvantage in the domain of sex and love. i admire tremendously what butler did here – the courage it took to write this on-the-surface reprehensible and distasteful book, her artistic integrity, her vulnerability. <br /></span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><span

class="ReviewText"><section class="ReviewText__content"><div class="TruncatedText"><div class="TruncatedText__text TruncatedText__text--5" data-testid="contentContainer"><div><span class="Formatted">One of the best books I've read is <i>Kindred</i>, Octavia Butler's 1979 time travel novel. Had it been published twenty years earlier, I'm sure it would've put her on Rod Serling's radar as he scouted writers for <i>The Twilight Zone</i>. Butler's use of dark fantasy to dramatize issues of social injustice and racism, and explore our reaction to genocide, wrapped me up in a spell. I hesitated to read more of Butler's work, fearing it wouldn't measure up.<br /><br /><i>Fledgling</i> doesn't measure up. I scanned the second half of the novel so I wouldn't have to abandon it and pin it with one star, but this book warrants a rating that low. Butler's final novel, published in 2005 a year before her death, apparently came after a period of writer's block, depression and health issues. I can only speculate that the author wanted the book finished before her time ran out, but this effort is a major disappointment.<br /><br />The story is the first person account of an adolescent girl who awakens in a cave with no memory of who she is or how she came to be there. She finds herself able to devour an animal that comes near her and though naked and covered with scars, begins to heal herself. She wanders through a small village that seems to have been burned down recently and stumbling onto a road, lures a motorist to stop to help.<br /><br />Wright Hamlin is a 23-year-old construction worker renting a nearby cabin from his aunt and uncle. The girl, which Wright names "Renee," bites him on the hand, but rather than feel pain, he instead feels a strange ecstasy. Knowing she's far too young for him to get involved with, Wright nonetheless feels a connection to her. He concludes rather quickly that she is a vampire. He takes her home.<br /><br />Of the thousand different directions Butler could've taken the story -- I would've liked one focusing on the doomed relationship between Wright and "Renee" -- Butler instead has her characters launch into talking, the sort speculation found in futuristic science fiction novels. Poorly written futuristic science fiction novels.<br /><br />With her physical and psychological control of Wright complete, Renee leads him back to the ruins, where she makes contact with a man who reveals himself to be her father. "Renee" is really Shori Matthews, a 53-year-old being known as an Ina who has some of the characteristics which folklore attributes to vampires: immortality, the need of blood for sustenance, feats of physical strength, aversion to sunlight. <br /><br />Shori, who's black, is an experiment by her family to develop a dark skinned Ina who can stay awake by day, Ina being heavy sleepers. This genetic kink may be the reason Shori's mother and aunts were wiped out in the village. While the racial and hereditary makeup of Shori is intriguing, it isn't a story, and instead of telling the reader a story, Butler devotes page after page of the novel to talking. <br /><br />I don't want to read a novel about characters discussing vampires. I want to read a novel about characters <i>doing something</i> about vampires. This is the failure of <i>Fledgling</i>. The book reads like a first draft, a junk draft, with a lot of ideas and concepts and family history that might've been useful to the author in later drafts, but what's being passed off as the book isn't fit for publication.<br /><br />The dialogue is atrocious, worse than a Chinese martial arts film dubbed into English.<br /><br /><i>"And no doubt that will make you feel better," she said. "But it won't help you. You've shown your teeth, Shori. They're sharp and set in strong female jaws. You are now less the victim and more the potentially dangerous opponent. You begin to overshadow your dead."</i><br /><br />There's a lot of <i>What did it all mean?</i> and <i>What had I done?</i>, rudimentary, Young Adult novel writing, which makes no sense if the main character is 53. The book is repetitive, convoluted and poorly edited. Worse, it's boring. The last quarter is essentially <i>Escape From the Planet of the Apes</i> with Shori being questioned by a commission and talking, talking, talking, about the differences between herself and her inquisitors. <br /><br />The idea of a black immortal, or one who resembled an 11-year-old girl, were unique and ripe for exploration. An idea I found repulsive and is explored ad nauseam is the symbiotic relationship between Ina and the human beings it gathers into a family unit to feed on, injecting a venom that make their symbioants dependent on them both physically and psychologically.<br /><br />There's a lot of writing here about being paired, being mated and being controlled. Interesting ideas, but I don't want to read ideas, and I don't want to read about characters being forced to do things without their consent. It's not only immoral, it's boring. <br /><br /><i>Fledgling</i> is not what I'd call a vampire novel. The speculative aspect sticks much closer to futuristic science fiction and there's nothing remotely eerie about this. For a book about an immortal predator and the impact it has on a community, read <i>Let the Right One In</i> instead.</span></div></div></div></section></section><section

class="ReviewText"><section class="ReviewText__content"><div class="TruncatedText"><div class="TruncatedText__text TruncatedText__text--5" data-testid="contentContainer"><div><span class="Formatted">I had a twenty year love affair with Anne Rice's vampires. It's no wonder I was most often single during those years because a real-world partner would probably have been jealous of my deep feelings and obsessions over Maharet and Mekare, Merrick, Pandora, Mona, and yes, the Brat Prince himself, Lestat. <br><br>So it's perhaps odd that I've never met a vampire outside of Anne Rice's books that I liked. There's never been another vampire story to draw me in and get under my skin. I usually give vampire books a pass because of this but, having loved Octavia E Butler's <a href="https://goodreads.com/book/show/39643840.Earthseed_The_Complete_Series" title="Earthseed The Complete Series by Octavia E. Butler" rel="noopener">Earthseed: The Complete Series</a> books and wanting to read something else by her, I decided to give this a try. Also, it was the only one of her books available without placing a hold.<br><br>Well.... it's not Anne Rice and Shori did not make me fall obsessively in love with her. In fact, I don't know how <i>any</i> of the characters fell in love with her... it was gross.<br><br>Though Shori is a 53-year old vampire, she looks like "a child of ten or eleven". And we have grown ass men wanting to have sex with her. It's disgusting. And not just wanting to, but doing it. <br><br><b>What the fuck, Octavia Butler????</b><br><br>Shori narrates the story and you can tell she's lived longer than ten years by her words, but still. I  kept picturing this young girl and these.... men. Her first, Wright, is so relieved when he learns she's actually 53 years old because it means he can have sex with her because he's oh so attracted to her child's body.<br><br><img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1611930668ra/30778370.gif" width="300" height="150" alt="Raven Thats So Raven GIF - Raven ThatsSoRaven DisneyChannel GIFs" class="gr-hostedUserImg"><br><br>That just ruined the book for me. As for the rest of the story? It was ok but nothing spectacular:<br><br>Shori wakes up alone and in pain, injuries on most of her body. She has no memory of who she is. She has an insatiable need to eat raw meat which helps her injuries heal.  <br><br>When she is strong enough, she stumbles along a road where Wright happens to drive by and picks her up. Because he's <s>such a good person</s> a loathsome pedophile, he lets her move in with him while keeping her secret from his neighbors and family. <br><br>The book has Shori struggling to find out who and what she is. When she learns there was an attack on her family, killing all but her, Shori wants to hunt down the people responsible. <br><br>So that's the story - Shori doing detective work and learning the history of the Ina (vampires)..... and having a considerable amount of sex and otherwise erotic acts with adult humans in between.<br><br>I probably would have enjoyed learning the history of the Ina if I hadn't found the book so disturbing. It was interesting that Shori is genetically modified and I appreciate what Ms. Butler did, in bringing out the stupidity of racism. <br><br>It was often repetitive though, so even had it not been for the disgusting pedophilia, I probably wouldn't give this book more than 3 stars.</span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><span class="TruncatedItems

class="ReviewText"><section class="ReviewText__content"><div class="TruncatedText"><div class="TruncatedText__text TruncatedText__text--5" data-testid="contentContainer"><div><span class="Formatted">This was so disappointing. I'm actually bothered by this. I'm such a big fan of Octavia Butler's novel <i>
  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/620801510?book_show_action=false" rel="nofollow noopener">Kindred</a>
</i> and this one (her last before her unfortunate passing) almost felt like it was written by someone else. The book actually sports a really great concept that's ripe for tons of conflict and exploration of ideas and themes. The story is about an amnesiac 11-year-old-looking girl and her rediscovery that she is in fact an experimental member of the Ina, a vampiric species that live in a mutually symbiotic relationship with several humans. She is one of a few Ina that have dark skin, who's melanin might be the key to withstanding the sun rays. There are so many cool ideas that can stem from these concepts and that's what kept me reading longer than I normally would have with this book. <br /><br />But these cool concepts are totally betrayed by not only the blandest plot you could ever come up with from such a great idea, but also some of the dullest and most lackluster writing I've ever come across. While Butler's work on <i>Kindred</i> had such an urgent insistence to it and a great sense of personality and pace, the work in this one was devoid of not only that but also lacked any flavor or style, leaving nothing but dry, awkward, and totally redundant dialogue along with wikipedia-like info dumps about Butler's ideas every two pages. She should have taken a note from George R. R. Martin's <i>Song of Ice and Fire</i> series for a good example of how to organically provide tons of exposition. And I think it might have been a mistake to write this in first-person. Not only is it already tricky to successfully pull off an amnesiac protagonist in first-person, but our heroine's inner dialogue was laughable and sometimes cringe-inducing at times, with lots of annoying "what have I done?'s" and "could it be?'s" throughout, like a bad YA-book written for pre-teen girls.<br /><br />I'll give the book a couple stars because it does bring up some great ideas about sex, race and racism, and free-will, but a better constructed delivery of these ideas could have turned this into an utter masterpiece. And I keep bringing up her work on <i>Kindred</i> because it proves that Butler could have done better. I read somewhere that she was having a hard time writing while taking medication later in her years and wasn't very confident about <i>fledgling</i>. So she probably knew she was capable of more as well.</span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><span class="TruncatedItems TruncatedItems--span"><span

class="ReviewText"><section class="ReviewText__content"><div class="TruncatedText"><div class="TruncatedText__text TruncatedText__text--5" data-testid="contentContainer"><div><span class="Formatted">Imagine that you are driving home one day and come across an interesting looking person by the side of the road. You invite this person into your car and are immediately drawn to him or her in extreme ways – after only a few hours together, you want to sleep with this person, do everything that he or she says, and give up everything in your life to devote yourself to this person's needs.<br /><br />You are attracted to this person above all others, and he/she can give you the greatest pleasure of your entire life. Maybe you have a few qualms and try to leave for a time – maybe this person even gives you the option to leave, but in the end, you can’t. You <i>love</i> this person.<br /><br />If you’ve ever read a paranormal romance, then you’ll be very familiar with this entire storyline – this person is a supernatural creature.<br /><br />Now imagine that this person is also a ten year old girl.<br /><br />I’ll just wait here for a minute while you finish throwing up.<br /><br />Done? Okay, well…now imagine that you’re a large, hairy man in your twenties.<br /><br />Go ahead, I’ll wait here.<br /><br />I’m not sure if I think that Octavia Butler is a genius or if this book is disgusting. Every time a sex/intimacy scene came up (and it was quite often, as the main character Shori basically has some sexual activity along with every single feeding = several times a day) I felt horrified, nauseous, traumatized. I wanted to do anything but have to listen to this vampire, who <i>does</i> find out that she’s 54 eventually, but still looks exactly like a ten year old child, have sex with various adults. I was thoroughly, thoroughly disgusted.<br /><br />When I expressed my discomfort about the story, my friend <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1072582-kaethe" rel="nofollow noopener">Kaethe</a> posted this on my review:<br /><br /><i>“It's more a black hole sucking the sexy out of the legend.”</i><br /><br />And that made me realize: isn’t this the way that we’re <i>supposed</i> to feel about vampires? About this whole scenario, really? Isn’t it supposed to make us frightened, ill, and uncomfortable that a paranormal creature could enter our lives, strip away even our most tightly held morals, and bind us to her will? <br /> <br />Vampires today have become so heavily romanticized, so humanized, that they are no longer alien, no longer frightening. They’ve become sexy and mysterious, the stuff of fantasies. But not here. It took me the entire book to finally accept that this creature, this “little girl” <i>is completely and utterly not human.</i><br /><br />And I don’t think that I’ve felt that way about a vampire in fiction since, well, <i>ever.</i><br /><br />So I have to give major kudos to Octavia Butler for that. However, I do have to wonder – was it entirely intentional? The entire society of the Ina – the vampire race – seems to be idealized a bit too much for me. The humans may suffer some minor jealousies, but they’re all basically happy to give up their lives and join a communal type home with many other “symbiants,” all devoted (blood donors and sexual partners) to one vampire. And although Shori’s apparent physical age sucks every iota of potential sexiness out of this story for me, she will grow up. All of her uncles, grandparents, and other relatives who are grown seem to fit exactly with the romanticized, humanized vampire stereotype.<br /><br />So in the end, I’m not entirely sure what I feel about this story, but it gave me a lot to think about.<br /></span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><span class="TruncatedItems TruncatedItems--span"><span

class="ReviewText"><section class="ReviewText__content"><div class="TruncatedText"><div class="TruncatedText__text TruncatedText__text--5" data-testid="contentContainer"><div><span class="Formatted">in the middle of the vampire/twilight craze Octavia Butler used the ancient blood sucking monster as a literary vehicle to combat racial intolerances. With a sort of trial at the end that echoed my favorite book <a href="https://goodreads.com/book/show/2657.To_Kill_a_Mockingbird" title="To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee" rel="noopener">To Kill a Mockingbird</a>. <br /><br />a woman wakes up in unbearable pain and with amnesia. it soon becomes clear that she is a supernatural creature and is told her name is Shori. it appears that someone attacked her and her family Who and why? is the mystery for the reader to discover. That's the synopsis and i was enthralled by the first chapter. Unfortunately i guessed the answers pretty easily. And my interest waned as i waited for the conclusion. A conclusion i was excited for and felt more than justified. The vampire lore Here is good. with my wife being goth I'm a bit of a vampire expert (we have watched every vampire movie we find) and i mean EVERY vampire movie! But it was dense folklore and dragged out the pursuit of justice. i did not expect a vampire council trial. but it went about the way i expected! the one thing i know from Kindred is Butler is great at writing relationships. like next level good in the sci-fi genre. the good news is in Fledgling she gets to work with a lot of these as Shori collects many surrogates who become bound to her. this is the best part of the book. Shori Juggling so many relationships was fun to read. there is a lot of sex in this book because it's about vampires. i was expecting that. but Shori being in the body of a juvenile made me uncomfortable. I could not shake that unease so i took a star off for that! <br /><br />Fledgling gets it's message of tolerance across very well. this echoed To kill a mockingbird greatly. Shori amnesia mirrored Scout's childish narrative perfectly. Filled with vampire Folklore and sex if that's you're thing. pick this up and let Octavia Butler wow you with her ability to make you connect with the relationships in her books! this could have been the beginning of a series, to bad it will never be. i would have enjoyed it. RIP Octavia Butler!</span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"></section><footer class="SocialFooter"><div data-testid="stats"

In 1995, she became the first science fiction writer to receive the MacArthur Foundation \"Genius\" Grant.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAfter her father died, Butler was raised by her widowed mother. Extremely shy as a child, Octavia found an outlet at the library reading fantasy, and in writing. She began writing science fiction as a teenager. She attended community college during the Black Power movement, and while participating in a local writer's workshop was encouraged to attend the Clarion Workshop, which focused on science fiction.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eShe soon sold her first stories and by the late 1970s had become sufficiently successful as an author that she was able to pursue writing full-time. Her books and short stories drew the favorable attention of the public and awards judges. She also taught writer's workshops, and eventually relocated to Washington state. Butler died of a stroke at the age of 58. Her papers are held in the research collection of the Huntington Library.","isGrAuthor":false,"works":{"__typename":"ContributorWorksConnection","totalCount":84},"profileImageUrl":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/authors/1242244143i/29535._UX200_CR0,25,200,200_.jpg","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/29535.Octavia_E_Butler","user":null,"viewerIsFollowing":null,"followers":{"__typename":"ContributorFollowersConnection","totalCount":11409}},"Book:kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.70FQss1iAb_JhuMWyRof9Q":{"id":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.70FQss1iAb_JhuMWyRof9Q","__typename":"Book","title":"Fledgling","titleComplete":"Fledgling","legacyId":60925,"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60925.Fledgling","description":"\u003ci\u003eFledgling\u003c/i\u003e, Octavia Butler's new novel after a seven year break, is the story of an apparently young, amnesiac girl whose alarmingly inhuman needs and abilities lead her to a startling conclusion: She is in fact a genetically modified, 53-year-old vampire.

admit that I wanted to like this more than I did simply because I am a big fan of Kindred. I was slightly ambivalent about another book on vampires, however, and while I tried not to take that into serious account when reading Butler, it still crept in.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMostly, however, I liked the book fine. Any major issues I have can be neatly summed up in my opinion on quasi-pedophile literature in general. It's designed to make us squirm. If it doesn't make you squirm then maybe you're reading just a tad too much pedo-literature. Suffice to say, I squirmed a lot. I tried telling myself over and over that a 53-year-old vampire with amnesia with the body of an eleven-year-old girl should be judged on the stated facts alone, not by the super-creepy visceral feel it evokes. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003ePutting that aside, the rest of the novel doesn't break any new ground. Far from it. Can anyone else remember a novel that starts out with an amnesiac MC? Anyone? Is it one out of six novels? By proportion, I do believe that about that many of us in real life must be amnesiac. It makes sense, doesn't it? That's probably why we keep forgetting how many times we've read novels with amnesiac main characters.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMoving on. Slow build, discovery that we're dead. Check.

Not extremely creative, just a tad or a bit more than a lot of creepy. The horror aspect went away pretty early and the novel fell into a comfortable settle in with her mind rolled lovers before it became Law and Order for bloodsuckers. It just feels like I've read this book before. Many times. And the only thing that makes it stand out is the fact that it creeps my non-pedo-self out.

I knew of course that Ms. Butler would never slum it with Stephenie Meyer, but the subject matter is kind of spoiled for me. Still, I am running out of Octavias to read so I did not want to skip one of her - all too few – novels just because of my disillusion with vampire fiction in general.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOctavia Butler writes entertaining books but they are never mindless entertainments, she always has her (non-pecuniary) reasons for writing them. So when she takes on the popular vampire genre you can be sure there is more to the story than sexy neck biting. To say that \u003ci\u003eFledgling\u003c/i\u003e is an allegory is to disregard Ms. Butler’s love of storytelling for its own sake. The book is not all about the allegory, you can completely ignore the underlying message and still enjoy the finely crafted narrative. Perhaps it will make you reflect on something you have experienced in real life, perhaps not, it does not matter. As usual with Octavia Butler's books, I found it to be compelling from page one. There was no need to familiarize myself with the setting, or the style, no need to take a peek at the book’s synopsis, just dive into it and let the lady work her magic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eFledgling\u003c/i\u003e is about Shori, a “young” 53-year-old vampire. At the beginning of the book, she wakes up in a cave, badly burned, injured, blind, and without memory of who or what she is. Fortunately, some poor, unsuspecting creature comes within her reach and she immediately eats it and starts healing rapidly, though her memory remains lost. She stumbles onto a road and a kindly unsuspecting chap picks her up in his car, to take her to a hospital. She refuses to go to a hospital, he won’t hear of her objections and so she bit him. A strange symbiotic relationship begins.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe main plot of the book concerns Shori’s attempt to find who tried to kill her, caused her to lose her memory, and - as she later learns -killed her entire family.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e“It doesn’t seem fair that you can’t convert us like all the stories say.” \u003cbr\u003e“That would be very strange,” I said. “If a dog bit a man, no one would expect the man to become a dog. He might get an infection and die, but that’s the worst.”\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I mentioned earlier, this is a sci-fi variation of vampire fiction. The vampires are not supernatural creatures but another species called “Ina” that have been living in secret among humans for as long as they can remember. They do need blood but they do not kill humans for it. Instead, they form symbiotic relationships with selected humans, and the symbionts benefit from the chemicals in Ina’s venom which extend their lives and cure their illnesses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e“His memory should improve because I was with him, because now and then, I would bite him, injecting whatever I injected into people when I bit them.”\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe sci-fi aspect of \u003ci\u003eFledgling\u003c/i\u003e makes a nice change and the concept somewhat more believable. The novel is masterfully plotted and paced without a dull moment, though some readers may be put off by the odd (non-explicit) scenes of kinky vampire sex, and moments of sentimentality. Shori, in spite of being a vampire, is a fairly typical Butler protagonist, strong-willed, compassionate, and black. The theme of being an outcast, being lonely, and having the courage and moral fortitude to overcome these issues in a positive manner is something Butler often returns to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1471750787i/20102383.jpg\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThe author has some fun with the vampire tropes (as can be seen from some of the quotes below) but, more importantly, she weaved in the perennial themes of tolerance, dealing with racial prejudice, and fortitude in the face of adversity. There is some violence in this book, nothing overly graphic or extreme; it would be nice to be able to resolve all conflicts without resorting violence but this is not really an option under the circumstances here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, another very satisfying Octavia Butler book, I think I only have a couple left unread, and one of them is an anthology.

Yeah, well I’m trying to find the good ones, not the dreck that’s jumped onto the Twilight bandwagon. And quite frankly I didn’t pick this one up because it was a vampire book per se, but because it was one by Octavia Butler, whose work I’ve been meaning to look into more, and this is the only stand-alone that I’m aware of. It turned out to be a good book, though there are some possibly ‘problematic’ issues with it.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn some ways there are superficial resemblances between this one and the last vampire book I read \u003ca href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/943402.Let_the_Right_One_In\" title=\"Let the Right One In by John Ajvide Lindqvist\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eLet the Right One In\u003c/a\u003e: both books have as their star apparently pre-pubescent vampires who have ‘complicated’ relationships with their human companions. In Lindqvist’s case it was a Renfield-like adult who was enamoured of the vampire-child for whom he obtained blood and the young boy who becomes a part of her life. In the case of Butler’s book the vampire in question, Shori, isn’t even only apparently pre-pubescent…according to vampire physiology she is in fact still a child, though that still translates to her being much older than her appearance would suggest (around 52 years old in fact). Despite this fact the relationships she has with the humans around her bear all of the appearances of a pedophilic relationship, at least from the outside.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eYou see in Butler’s take on the vampire mythology the Ina (what vampires call themselves) are not undead. They don’t actually know what they are, whether it be an off-shoot of humanity or an alien race, but they are incredibly long-lived, are harmed by direct sunlight, and require blood (preferably human blood) to survive. So far Butler follows the myth pretty closely. Where she deviates to the greatest extent is around the relationships that they have with their ‘prey’. Far from being nocturnal hunters out to slaughter as many human cattle as possible to feed their blood thirst, these vampires actually maintain a group of humans (called symbionts) who share their lives with the Ina and in exchange for the benefits that Ina venom provides to humans they give the vampire their blood, as well as personal and emotional companionship. What benefits does the venom in Ina saliva provide? Well longer life for one: human symbionts live about twice as long as normal humans. They are also immune to most illnesses and tend to stay young through most of their lives as symbionts (depending on when they were ‘turned’ of course). The sex is also great. The mere act of being fed upon seems to provoke a reaction in the symbiont akin to the best sex you’ve ever had, and the Ina also like indulging in sex-play with their symbionts and the fact that they aren’t cross-fertile is just icing on the cake, right? The down-side? Well symbionts become addicted to the Ina venom in their body…actually to the specific venom of their personal Ina, and will soon go crazy and die without it. They also end up having an attachment to their Ina that is so close they cannot refuse a request (or order) made by them. Also if they are the jealous kind they will likely have an uncomfortable life in the Ina’s family since one Ina generally requires at least seven or eight humans to be his or her personal symbionts (or harem if you will) so there’s a lot of sharing…of everything…going on.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eHow does this all play out when the Ina in question is apparently an eleven year old black girl whose first symbiont is a white male in his mid-twenties? I’ll let you decide. All I can say is that I enjoyed the story from most angles. Butler’s idea that vampires would be more likely to shepherd the humans they require for survival instead of going on nightly and gratuitous killing sprees made a heck of a lot of sense. I’ve always wondered what those vampires in stories where they are coming out of hiding and hunting down humanity are thinking: who are they going to feed on once they wipe out the human race and why create an imminent resource shortage even if they plan on doing something about it in the long term? \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe story opens as Shori awakens in pain and confusion in a cave and immediately succumbs to her base instincts in order to survive. As she continues to hunt, feed, and heal she comes more to herself, but still has no memory of exactly who, or what, she is. Eventually she makes her way down to a nearby community that has been utterly destroyed in a fire. There are no bodies and she has no memory of the place, but thinks it may have something to do with her. Deciding to look for other people in the hope that they can help her she eventually comes across Wright and finds herself instinctively attracted to him and ends up making him her first ‘symbiont’. Together they must learn exactly who and what Shori is and their questions lead them into dangerous territory, for it turns out that Shori was an experiment of some members of the Ina/vampire community: an attempt to graft Ina with human African-American genes in order to combat their natural weakness to the sun. Not all members of the Ina community were in favour of this and so Shori’s quest of discovery also becomes a fight for survival as she slowly tries to regain a semblance of what she was before her ‘accident’.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAny ick factor aside I thought that Butler’s depiction of the relationships that developed between Ina and their symbionts was well done. There are obviously questions of freedom and choice involved here. After all if you were basically chemically conditioned to love someone, to obey them, to be utterly devoted to them what would it mean about any choice, any feeling you had for them? On the other hand, most symbionts are made aware of the implications of their union with an Ina before any final step is taken in the bonding…of course that might just be akin to saying they only give the addict a couple of doses of the drug and they aren’t yet technically dependent on it before asking them if they want any more. Still I got the feeling that most of the relationships between Ina and symbionts were loving and ‘real’ and it was apparent that the Ina were just as dependent on their symbionts as vice versa, and not just for blood: the emotional bond seemed to go both ways. So, does Butler turn love, devotion, and desire into purely biological responses and imperatives or could it be argued that even in human relationships they already are? How much of what we do and decide about those in our lives is truly ‘free’? How much is pre-determined by our biology, our experiences, and our background? Who can say what’s really behind that ‘spark’ that attracts you to one person and not another? It may not be Ina venom, but is it something any less chemically or physiologically induced? I don’t know I’m just rambling here, but for some reason I just wasn’t as bothered by the venom element of the Ina-Symbiont bond. Maybe I’m just a submissive at heart.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThere is of course also an investigation of race and purity. Not only is Shori visibly Black, a member of a human minority (though apparently to Ina that has no importance), she is a hybrid: a half-breed mix of Ina and human genes whose end is to produce a better, stronger Ina capable of overcoming the natural weaknesses and limitations of the traditional ‘pure breed’. So now we have Shori straddling an interesting dichotomy: on the one hand she is basically the product of a eugenic experiment (though one whose methods appear to have been benign) whose end goal is something that might be called a ‘master race’; on the other hand she is the victim of horrific persecution and bigotry for not being ‘pure Ina’ and her life, and that of those she loves, is in danger as a result. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWill you like this story? I don’t know. I did, but I can see how many people would find it, as I mentioned above, problematic. Butler’s prose is fine, though nothing to write home about and I found a few instances where I thought she over-described a scene (such as adding details about the kind of sandwiches and other paraphernalia they packed for lunch) in ways that seemed unnecessary. Overall though I found myself carried along with the story and thought that she did a very good job of both keeping the plot moving and doing it through the development of well-rounded and interesting characters. Ultimately this was for me a story about just that: characters and the personal relationships and growth that they experienced.","rating":4,"shelving":{"__typename":"Shelving","shelf":{"__typename":"Shelf","name":"read","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1262683?shelf=read"},"taggings":[{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"fantasy","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1262683?shelf=fantasy"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"sci-fi","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1262683?shelf=sci-fi"}}],"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1165387826"},"likeCount":70,"viewerHasLiked":null,"commentCount":13,"viewerCanComment({\"resourceType\":\"review\"})":null},"Contributor:kca://author/amzn1.gr.author.v1.uawappZLajwWJNArv4xuKw":{"id":"kca://author/amzn1.gr.author.v1.uawappZLajwWJNArv4xuKw","__typename":"Contributor","works":{"__typename":"ContributorWorksConnection","totalCount":44}},"User:2190064":{"id":2190064,"__typename":"User","legacyId":2190064,"imageUrlSquare":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1624065141i/2190064._UX200_CR0,0,200,200_.jpg","isAuthor":true,"textReviewsCount":2829,"viewableName":"Nenia ✨ I yeet my books back and forth ✨ Campbell","isBlockedByViewer":false,"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2190064-nenia-i-yeet-my-books-back-and-forth-campbell","contributor":{"__ref":"Contributor:kca://author/amzn1.gr.author.v1.uawappZLajwWJNArv4xuKw"},"isFollowing":false,"isFriend":false,"followersCount":13469},"Review:kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.xuHJDZhSVhaXsik3CN-Lpg":{"id":"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.xuHJDZhSVhaXsik3CN-Lpg","__typename":"Review","book":{"__ref":"Book:kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.70FQss1iAb_JhuMWyRof9Q"},"creator":{"__ref":"User:2190064"},"recommendFor":null,"updatedAt":1622930873828,"createdAt":1534999813992,"spoilerStatus":false,"lastRevisionAt":1536219178160,"text":"\u003ca href=\"http://readasaurus.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1459070464i/18565492.jpg\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/neniagram/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e || \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/NeniaCampbell\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e || \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/aficionenias/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e || \u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Nenia-Campbell/e/B00AWVRKMS\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eAmazon\u003c/a\u003e || \u003ca href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/mightbeamisprin/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ePinterest\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am shocked that this was published by the same Octavia E.

It felt like it was written by a totally different person. If I hadn't looked at the publication date and seen the \"2005,\" I would have thought that this was a less-successful first novel. That seriously bums me out because I love vampire novels, and the idea of reading a novel about a black vampire that explores the themes of racism within a supernatural context sounded fascinating, especially since I had loved what I'd read of this author before and how she explored similar themes within the science-fiction framework.

I get that Octavia Butler was a daring writer who pushed boundaries of what was socially acceptable in order to challenge the status quo (something my critic seemed to be arguing, albeit slightly less eloquently), but it's my right to say when I feel like an author goes too far for my own personal tastes.

The problem with this book is that it's slow AF, and while the human and compassionate part of you wants Shori to get revenge for the awful things that happened to her, the reader and hedonist part of you is going to be bored off your ass waiting for anything resembling a climax (EW, no, not that kind of climax - get out of here you gross person) to happen.

– butler’s easy (she’d been doing this for years, and her novels always tread on the dark edge of the forbidden, which is probably why she chose to write sci-fi or speculative fiction) dipping in her own unconscious, into a pool of profound woman/lesbian longing that is rarely represented in literature. the whole book seems to me an answer to freud’s famous question “what do women want?” it seems both the representation of deep-seated and (therefore) tabooed female desires and the luscious, unbridled fantasy of their fulfillment. butler needs to push the envelope of difference in the desiring subject as much as possible. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eshori, the first person narrator, is unique both in the cast of characters who people the book and, perhaps more importantly, in the cast of characters who are likely to read the book, in a number of ways. as far as the former is concerned, she’s black (one of her brothers is also black but of a much lighter hue, and anyway he’s quickly dispatched by the assassins who are after shori’s family; a small number of humans are black as well, but their blackness is not a primary issue in the novel the way shori’s is), she’s alone (the Ina live in communities and return to communities: shori is alone and wants to stay that way, form her own family instead of joining an existing one), she’s small for her age, she’s remarkably poised, wise, and intelligent, and, above all, she’s an Ina-human hybrid. this last trait, alongside her blackness, is key in the novel, but since it raises interpretive issues other than the ones i have at heart here, i’ll set it aside. as far as the readers are concerned, she’s unique in being a sexually active, sexually promiscuous child who’s equally attracted to adult men and women.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003ethis is the thing that interests me most so this is what i’ll talk about from now on. shori, who looks like a human 10-year-old and is a 53-year-old Ina, is and isn’t a child in both worlds. from a human point of view, she of course belies appearances because she has 53 years of life under her belt. at the same time, not only does she look very much like a little girl to the human eye, but, also, she’s just undergone a pretty thorough and literal rebirth, and her memory is wiped entirely clean. when she gently bites her first human, he, a man of 23, experiences intense sexual (never described as such, but clearly that’s what it is) pleasure, and so does she. soon, she tells him that he can have sex with her if he wants to, because of the bond they have created through her feeding. the man may or may not feel instinctive reluctance to have sex what a small 10-year-old, but does nonetheless. shori is apparently (the sex scenes are not very detailed) an experienced lover, and this makes wright, the young man, feel altogether better, so that they go on to being regular lovers for the rest of the novel. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003ethis is of course intensely disturbing to the reader. what is an adult male doing having sex with a little abandoned kid he’s just rescued on the side of the road? vampires and their humans, though, have a unique relationship. first of all, vampires are incredibly powerful, not only physically (they live a long time, are always healthy, heal themselves from injuries, are superhumanly strong, etc.) but emotionally. the moment they bite someone, the person experiences a pleasure that makes him or her little more than putty in the vampire’s hands. what stands between this and exploitation is the profound love vampires have for their symbionst, and ethics. the vampires desire their humans just as much as their humans desire them. their bond is pretty much absolute. even though humans mate with each other and have children of their own (and vampires do the same), the bond between vampires and symbionts is stronger than any other – it is visceral, and necessary to the survival of both. since vampires live as long as four or five hundred years and human symbionts, to whom vampires communicate a lot of their physical gifts, to 150 to 200 years, vampires are doomed to losing their symbionts, and the experience is described in the novel as so devastating as to be barely endurable. whereas, though, vampires can replace their symbionts, symbionts will get sick and possibly die if they lose the vampire to whom they are bonded. other vampires can and will take over out of ethical obligation, but it doesn’t always work.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eas shori chooses and makes hers human after human, the reader’s pleasure deepens. the first human, wright, has little to no choice. both he and shori have no knowledge of what is going on between them, but, whatever it is, it’s irresistible to both of them. because she can’t feed on one human alone, shori then creeps into a woman’s bed at night and feeds on her. the woman is immediately, profoundly in love, and so is shori. technically they don’t have sex but they might as well have. these are the only two humans shori chooses. the other three she acquires in the book are, two of them, left-behind adult female symbionts of her father’s and brother’s, and, one, an adult male child of another symbiont who falls in love with shori and wants to be with her, and to whom shori is incredibly drawn. in other words, she has a profound attraction to three of her symbionts and only grows to love the other two. (two of her symbionts, the young man and the young woman she inherits from her brother, are also black).\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003ethe desire/fantasy this book portrays so effectively is that of total control over the love object, if not, possibly, over love itself. i submit that this is the desire/fantasy of those whose sexuality is chronically disempowered – queer people, women, who else? vampires cannot help reciprocating their humans’ love, but making this love authentic rather than exploitative is entirely a matter of ethical upbringing and ethical choices. shori, for instance, has to do violence to herself, at first, to allow herself to learn from her symbionts, some of whom have been living in vampire families for a long time and know way more about her people than she does. her willingness to treat her symbionts as equal is depicted as an act of great respect and humility on her part. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003emuch as the symbionts long for her, shori has complete control over whom she feeds on, whom she has sex with, whom she chooses to love. they don’t. she, also, is clearly the head of the family. she decides what gets done when; the symbionts only suggest. moreover, she’s responsible for making the symbionts get along with each other. this last trait is of course reminiscent of motherhood. in fact, the whole feeding-as-a-sexual-act thing is very much a symbol of mother love, even though, in this case, it is the mother(-child) who feeds on the (adult) children. this role reversal is profound on many levels. because it gestures toward the breaking of a primal taboo, it shocks and pleasures at the same time. the smallness of shori’s body is always on the front of the page. she climbs into her symbionts’ laps, is enfolded in their arms, and, when they have traditional intercourse, which happens only with the men, always needs to position herself, and have her symbiont position himself, carefully.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003einterestingly, while butler describes with great intensity the pleasure shori derives from licking her symbionts’ blood (she doesn’t always feed on them; sometimes she just tastes them because it gives them both tremendous pleasure), she does not describe the pleasure she derives from having sex. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eon the matter of sex: while shori is allowed to have sex with her symbionts, she is not yet allowed to have sex with other vampires, even though there is tremendous attraction between young male vampires and herself. i think she’d probably be around 16 in vampire age, and she’s too young to mate. for one, she couldn’t reproduce, for two, she’s just too young. the rules of proper-age mating hold just fine in the intra-vampire world. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003ewhich, problematically, sort of dehumanizes the humans. as i was reading the book, i kept slipping into a dissociative mode in which i perceived my dog as a symbiont. she is profoundly bonded to me, and loves me without any capacity for rejection. she obeys me even when it deprives her of pleasure (as when i ask her to go to her bed instead of staying on mine with me). i am bonded to her too, and i am as fiercely protective of her as vampires are of their symbionts. with all probability, she will die sooner than i and her death will devastate me. if i die before she does, someone will take her over out of ethical obligation to me.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eif we want to eschew the suggestion that butler dehumanizes her humans, we can say that, at least, she infantilizes them. i cannot imagine reading this book if i had kids. i can stand seeing my dog the way vampires in the book see humans, but it would disturb me way too much to see my kids that way.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eat the same time, seeing myself as a very powerful kid vampire who can control and attract so many adults (significantly, no one, vampire or not, is younger than shori in the book), and has such wise command of her emotions and her body, was tremendously thrilling to me. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003ei don’t know if the thrill i derived from this book is a consequence of my history and some damaged part of my emotional makeup, but i doubt all of those who liked it (and felt disturbed by it) have my same wounds. as i said, i think this book appeals to those – women, queer people, maybe disabled people, etc. – who are at a social disadvantage in the domain of sex and love. i admire tremendously what butler did here – the courage it took to write this on-the-surface reprehensible and distasteful book, her artistic integrity, her vulnerability. \u003cbr /\u003e","rating":5,"shelving":{"__typename":"Shelving","shelf":{"__typename":"Shelf","name":"read","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/210397?shelf=read"},"taggings":[{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"kids","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/210397?shelf=kids"}}],"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/77912139"},"likeCount":56,"viewerHasLiked":null,"commentCount":43,"viewerCanComment({\"resourceType\":\"review\"})":null},"Book:kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.t4b0znHgWoxZDnJTdz8org":{"id":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.t4b0znHgWoxZDnJTdz8org","__typename":"Book"},"User:26876584":{"id":26876584,"__typename":"User","legacyId":26876584,"imageUrlSquare":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1585885999i/26876584._UY200_CR33,0,200,200_.jpg","isAuthor":false,"textReviewsCount":420,"viewableName":"Joe Valdez","isBlockedByViewer":false,"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26876584-joe-valdez","contributor":null,"isFollowing":false,"isFriend":false,"followersCount":647},"Review:kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.-wkfj8idKvpfy2fL6O6ZdA":{"id":"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.-wkfj8idKvpfy2fL6O6ZdA","__typename":"Review","book":{"__ref":"Book:kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.t4b0znHgWoxZDnJTdz8org"},"creator":{"__ref":"User:26876584"},"recommendFor":null,"updatedAt":1623888343047,"createdAt":1397610427000,"spoilerStatus":false,"lastRevisionAt":1444424804000,"text":"One of the best books I've read is \u003ci\u003eKindred\u003c/i\u003e, Octavia Butler's 1979 time travel novel. Had it been published twenty years earlier, I'm sure it would've put her on Rod Serling's radar as he scouted writers for \u003ci\u003eThe Twilight Zone\u003c/i\u003e. Butler's use of dark fantasy to dramatize issues of social injustice and racism, and explore our reaction to genocide, wrapped me up in a spell.

Butler's final novel, published in 2005 a year before her death, apparently came after a period of writer's block, depression and health issues. I can only speculate that the author wanted the book finished before her time ran out, but this effort is a major disappointment.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe story is the first person account of an adolescent girl who awakens in a cave with no memory of who she is or how she came to be there. She finds herself able to devour an animal that comes near her and though naked and covered with scars, begins to heal herself. She wanders through a small village that seems to have been burned down recently and stumbling onto a road, lures a motorist to stop to help.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWright Hamlin is a 23-year-old construction worker renting a nearby cabin from his aunt and uncle. The girl, which Wright names \"Renee,\" bites him on the hand, but rather than feel pain, he instead feels a strange ecstasy. Knowing she's far too young for him to get involved with, Wright nonetheless feels a connection to her. He concludes rather quickly that she is a vampire. He takes her home.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOf the thousand different directions Butler could've taken the story -- I would've liked one focusing on the doomed relationship between Wright and \"Renee\" -- Butler instead has her characters launch into talking, the sort speculation found in futuristic science fiction novels. Poorly written futuristic science fiction novels.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWith her physical and psychological control of Wright complete, Renee leads him back to the ruins, where she makes contact with a man who reveals himself to be her father. \"Renee\" is really Shori Matthews, a 53-year-old being known as an Ina who has some of the characteristics which folklore attributes to vampires: immortality, the need of blood for sustenance, feats of physical strength, aversion to sunlight. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eShori, who's black, is an experiment by her family to develop a dark skinned Ina who can stay awake by day, Ina being heavy sleepers. This genetic kink may be the reason Shori's mother and aunts were wiped out in the village. While the racial and hereditary makeup of Shori is intriguing, it isn't a story, and instead of telling the reader a story, Butler devotes page after page of the novel to talking. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI don't want to read a novel about characters discussing vampires. I want to read a novel about characters \u003ci\u003edoing something\u003c/i\u003e about vampires. This is the failure of \u003ci\u003eFledgling\u003c/i\u003e. The book reads like a first draft, a junk draft, with a lot of ideas and concepts and family history that might've been useful to the author in later drafts, but what's being passed off as the book isn't fit for publication.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe dialogue is atrocious, worse than a Chinese martial arts film dubbed into English.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e\"And no doubt that will make you feel better,\" she said. \"But it won't help you. You've shown your teeth, Shori. They're sharp and set in strong female jaws. You are now less the victim and more the potentially dangerous opponent. You begin to overshadow your dead.\"\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThere's a lot of \u003ci\u003eWhat did it all mean?\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003eWhat had I done?\u003c/i\u003e, rudimentary, Young Adult novel writing, which makes no sense if the main character is 53. The book is repetitive, convoluted and poorly edited. Worse, it's boring. The last quarter is essentially \u003ci\u003eEscape From the Planet of the Apes\u003c/i\u003e with Shori being questioned by a commission and talking, talking, talking, about the differences between herself and her inquisitors. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe idea of a black immortal, or one who resembled an 11-year-old girl, were unique and ripe for exploration. An idea I found repulsive and is explored ad nauseam is the symbiotic relationship between Ina and the human beings it gathers into a family unit to feed on, injecting a venom that make their symbioants dependent on them both physically and psychologically.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThere's a lot of writing here about being paired, being mated and being controlled. Interesting ideas, but I don't want to read ideas, and I don't want to read about characters being forced to do things without their consent. It's not only immoral, it's boring. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eFledgling\u003c/i\u003e is not what I'd call a vampire novel. The speculative aspect sticks much closer to futuristic science fiction and there's nothing remotely eerie about this. For a book about an immortal predator and the impact it has on a community, read \u003ci\u003eLet the Right One In\u003c/i\u003e instead.","rating":2,"shelving":{"__typename":"Shelving","shelf":{"__typename":"Shelf","name":"read","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/26876584?shelf=read"},"taggings":[{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"paranormal-vampires","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/26876584?shelf=paranormal-vampires"}}],"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/911323329"},"likeCount":53,"viewerHasLiked":null,"commentCount":22,"viewerCanComment({\"resourceType\":\"review\"})":null},"Book:kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.AK8GSp4u8C43D9zYT_WDQw":{"id":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.AK8GSp4u8C43D9zYT_WDQw","__typename":"Book"},"User:3536004":{"id":3536004,"__typename":"User","legacyId":3536004,"imageUrlSquare":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1535136437i/3536004._UX200_CR0,2,200,200_.jpg","isAuthor":false,"textReviewsCount":581,"viewableName":"Jenna","isBlockedByViewer":false,"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3536004-jenna","contributor":null,"isFollowing":false,"isFriend":false,"followersCount":736},"Review:kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.meXEI4pY0q4NVgeVGLG35Q":{"id":"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.meXEI4pY0q4NVgeVGLG35Q","__typename":"Review","book":{"__ref":"Book:kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.AK8GSp4u8C43D9zYT_WDQw"},"creator":{"__ref":"User:3536004"},"recommendFor":null,"updatedAt":1626452003448,"createdAt":1611932920656,"spoilerStatus":false,"lastRevisionAt":1611959708792,"text":"I had a twenty year love affair with Anne Rice's vampires. It's no wonder I was most often single during those years because a real-world partner would probably have been jealous of my deep feelings and obsessions over Maharet and Mekare, Merrick, Pandora, Mona, and yes, the Brat Prince himself, Lestat. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo it's perhaps odd that I've never met a vampire outside of Anne Rice's books that I liked. There's never been another vampire story to draw me in and get under my skin. I usually give vampire books a pass because of this but, having loved Octavia E Butler's \u003ca href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/39643840.Earthseed_The_Complete_Series\" title=\"Earthseed The Complete Series by Octavia E.

Also, it was the only one of her books available without placing a hold.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell.... it's not Anne Rice and Shori did not make me fall obsessively in love with her. In fact, I don't know how \u003ci\u003eany\u003c/i\u003e of the characters fell in love with her... it was gross.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough Shori is a 53-year old vampire, she looks like \"a child of ten or eleven\". And we have grown ass men wanting to have sex with her. It's disgusting. And not just wanting to, but doing it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat the fuck, Octavia Butler????\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShori narrates the story and you can tell she's lived longer than ten years by her words, but still. I  kept picturing this young girl and these.... men. Her first, Wright, is so relieved when he learns she's actually 53 years old because it means he can have sex with her because he's oh so attracted to her child's body.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1611930668ra/30778370.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" alt=\"Raven Thats So Raven GIF - Raven ThatsSoRaven DisneyChannel GIFs\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat just ruined the book for me. As for the rest of the story? It was ok but nothing spectacular:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShori wakes up alone and in pain, injuries on most of her body. She has no memory of who she is. She has an insatiable need to eat raw meat which helps her injuries heal.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen she is strong enough, she stumbles along a road where Wright happens to drive by and picks her up. Because he's \u003cs\u003esuch a good person\u003c/s\u003e a loathsome pedophile, he lets her move in with him while keeping her secret from his neighbors and family. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe book has Shori struggling to find out who and what she is. When she learns there was an attack on her family, killing all but her, Shori wants to hunt down the people responsible. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that's the story - Shori doing detective work and learning the history of the Ina (vampires)..... and having a considerable amount of sex and otherwise erotic acts with adult humans in between.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI probably would have enjoyed learning the history of the Ina if I hadn't found the book so disturbing.

The book actually sports a really great concept that's ripe for tons of conflict and exploration of ideas and themes. The story is about an amnesiac 11-year-old-looking girl and her rediscovery that she is in fact an experimental member of the Ina, a vampiric species that live in a mutually symbiotic relationship with several humans. She is one of a few Ina that have dark skin, who's melanin might be the key to withstanding the sun rays. There are so many cool ideas that can stem from these concepts and that's what kept me reading longer than I normally would have with this book. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut these cool concepts are totally betrayed by not only the blandest plot you could ever come up with from such a great idea, but also some of the dullest and most lackluster writing I've ever come across. While Butler's work on \u003ci\u003eKindred\u003c/i\u003e had such an urgent insistence to it and a great sense of personality and pace, the work in this one was devoid of not only that but also lacked any flavor or style, leaving nothing but dry, awkward, and totally redundant dialogue along with wikipedia-like info dumps about Butler's ideas every two pages. She should have taken a note from George R. R. Martin's \u003ci\u003eSong of Ice and Fire\u003c/i\u003e series for a good example of how to organically provide tons of exposition. And I think it might have been a mistake to write this in first-person. Not only is it already tricky to successfully pull off an amnesiac protagonist in first-person, but our heroine's inner dialogue was laughable and sometimes cringe-inducing at times, with lots of annoying \"what have I done?'s\" and \"could it be?'s\" throughout, like a bad YA-book written for pre-teen girls.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI'll give the book a couple stars because it does bring up some great ideas about sex, race and racism, and free-will, but a better constructed delivery of these ideas could have turned this into an utter masterpiece. And I keep bringing up her work on \u003ci\u003eKindred\u003c/i\u003e because it proves that Butler could have done better. I read somewhere that she was having a hard time writing while taking medication later in her years and wasn't very confident about \u003ci\u003efledgling\u003c/i\u003e.

Every time a sex/intimacy scene came up (and it was quite often, as the main character Shori basically has some sexual activity along with every single feeding = several times a day) I felt horrified, nauseous, traumatized. I wanted to do anything but have to listen to this vampire, who \u003ci\u003edoes\u003c/i\u003e find out that she’s 54 eventually, but still looks exactly like a ten year old child, have sex with various adults.

The humans may suffer some minor jealousies, but they’re all basically happy to give up their lives and join a communal type home with many other “symbiants,” all devoted (blood donors and sexual partners) to one vampire. And although Shori’s apparent physical age sucks every iota of potential sexiness out of this story for me, she will grow up. All of her uncles, grandparents, and other relatives who are grown seem to fit exactly with the romanticized, humanized vampire stereotype.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSo in the end, I’m not entirely sure what I feel about this story, but it gave me a lot to think about.\u003cbr /\u003e","rating":3,"shelving":{"__typename":"Shelving","shelf":{"__typename":"Shelf","name":"read","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1886642?shelf=read"},"taggings":[{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"paranormal","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1886642?shelf=paranormal"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"sci-fi","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1886642?shelf=sci-fi"}}],"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/246960742"},"likeCount":35,"viewerHasLiked":null,"commentCount":32,"viewerCanComment({\"resourceType\":\"review\"})":null},"User:87153885":{"id":87153885,"__typename":"User","legacyId":87153885,"imageUrlSquare":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1616619706i/87153885._UX200_CR0,33,200,200_.jpg","isAuthor":false,"textReviewsCount":147,"viewableName":"Lee  (the Book Butcher)","isBlockedByViewer":false,"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/87153885-lee-the-book-butcher","contributor":null,"isFollowing":false,"isFriend":false,"followersCount":35},"Review:kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.Ctx8dt7-OpQb8zCQ-eyjGA":{"id":"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.Ctx8dt7-OpQb8zCQ-eyjGA","__typename":"Review","book":{"__ref":"Book:kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.70FQss1iAb_JhuMWyRof9Q"},"creator":{"__ref":"User:87153885"},"recommendFor":null,"updatedAt":1625514124267,"createdAt":1615935567883,"spoilerStatus":false,"lastRevisionAt":1615938182433,"text":"in the middle of the vampire/twilight craze Octavia Butler used the ancient blood sucking monster as a literary vehicle to combat racial intolerances.

Shori Juggling so many relationships was fun to read. there is a lot of sex in this book because it's about vampires. i was expecting that. but Shori being in the body of a juvenile made me uncomfortable.
